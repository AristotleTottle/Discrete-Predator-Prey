# Discrete-Predator-Prey

Bifurcation-Diagrams.R --> used to create 2- and 3- dimensional bifurcation diagrams for the discrete predator-prey system

Logistic-with-ODE.R   --> used to create Figure 1 in the paper

Logistic.R             --> used to create Figures 2, 3, and 4

Predator-prey-ODE.R    --> used to create Figure 6

Raw-Code.R             --> used for numerical computations throughout the research process
